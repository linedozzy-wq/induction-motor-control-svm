# Induction Motor Control with S-Curve Ramp and SVM

## Overview
Embedded implementation of a scalar V/f control system for an induction motor
using a TI TMS320F28035 DSP. Includes custom Space Vector PWM and smooth
S-curve speed profiling.

## Features
- S-curve speed ramp generator
- Custom Space Vector PWM (SVM)
- ADC-based current and speed measurement
- Experimental motor parameter identification
- 5 kHz real-time control loop

## Technologies
- Embedded C
- TI TMS320F28035
- Code Composer Studio
- SimInTech

## Status
Educational / demonstrator project
